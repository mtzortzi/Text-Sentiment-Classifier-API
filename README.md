# Text-Sentiment-Classifier-API
This project is a simple REST API for sentiment analysis built with FastAPI and HuggingFace Transformers. It uses the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model to classify English text as positive,  negative or (rarely) neutral, and it returns a confidence score.
